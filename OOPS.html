  <!-- OOPS Concepts
1:-What is a class?
A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member,
and some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes 
the data and functions that are defined in the class.
-----------------------------------------
2:-What is an object?
An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviors defined 
in the class template. In the real world, an object is an actual entity to which a user interacts, whereas class is just the 
blueprint for that object. So the objects consume space and have some characteristic behavior.
For example, a specific car.
-----------------------------------------
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inharitance, Polymorphism
 
Abstraction:-showing only what is necessary
-----------------------------------------
Encapsulation:- hide complexity or Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do
a specific job, without revealing unnecessary details.
Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:
1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object.
2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class.

OR
abstraction can be achieved by using encapsulation through applying access modifier specially making method to private.
-----------------------------------------
Inheritance:-mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

Types of inheritance:-
Single inheritance
Multiple inheritances
Multi-level inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance
Hybrid inheritance
-----------------------------------------
Polymorphism:- is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
OR
Polymorphism is composed of two words - “poly” which means “many”, and “morph” which means “shapes”. Therefore Polymorphism 
refers to something that has many shapes.

Type of polymorphism
Compile time(static or early binding):-Or overloading one function name with diffrent parameter
Run time(Dynamic or late binding):-Overriding, function is being overriding using virtula key word
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interfaces:- 
Interface in C# is a blueprint of a class. It is like abstract class because all the methods which are
declared inside the interface are abstract methods. It cannot have method body and cannot be 
instantiated.
It is used to achieve multiple inheritance which can't be achieved by class.
-----------------------------------------
What is a subclass(child class)?
The subclass is a part of Inheritance. The subclass is an entity, which inherits from another class. It is also known as the child class.
-----------------------------------------
Define a superclass(parent class)?
Superclass is also a part of Inheritance. The superclass is an entity, which allows subclasses or child classes to inherit from itself.
-----------------------------------------
What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a special class containing abstract methods. The significance of abstract class is that the abstract 
methods inside it are not implemented and only declared. So as a result, when a subclass inherits the abstract class and needs
to use its abstract methods, they need to define and implement them.
-----------------------------------------
How is an abstract class different from an interface?
Interface and abstract class both are special types of classes that contain only the methods declaration and not their 
implementation. But the interface is entirely different from an abstract class. The main difference between the two is that, 
when an interface is implemented, the subclass must define all its methods and provide its implementation. Whereas when an 
abstract class is inherited, the subclass does not need to provide the definition of its abstract method, until and unless
 the subclass is using it.

Also, an abstract class can contain abstract methods as well as non-abstract methods.
-----------------------------------------
Can you create an instance of an abstract class?
No. Instances of an abstract class cannot be created because it does not have a complete implementation. However, instances of 
subclass inheriting the abstract class can be created.

-----------------------------------------
What is meant by Garbage Collection in OOPs world?
Object-oriented programming revolves around entities like objects. Each object consumes memory and there can be multiple objects
of a class. So if these objects and their memories are not handled properly, then it might lead to certain memory-related 
errors and the system might fail.

Garbage collection refers to this mechanism of handling the memory in the program. Through garbage collection, the unwanted 
memory is freed up by removing the objects that are no longer needed.
-----------------------------------------
How much memory does a class occupy?
Classes do not consume any memory. They are just a blueprint based on which objects are created. Now when objects are created, 
they actually initialize the class members and methods and therefore consume memory.

-----------------------------------------
Is it always necessary to create objects from class?
No. An object is necessary to be created if the base class has non-static methods. But if the class has static methods, 
then objects don’t need to be created. You can call the class method directly in this case, using the class name.
-----------------------------------------
What is a constructor?
Constructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The constructors serve the special purpose of 
initializing the objects.
For example, suppose there is a class with the name “MyClass”, then when you instantiate this class, you pass the syntax:
MyClass myClassObject = new MyClass();

Now here, the method called after “new” keyword - MyClass(), is the constructor of this class. This will help to instantiate 
the member data and methods and assign them to the object myClassObject.

What are the various types of constructors in C++?
Default constructor: The default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument. It has no parameters.
Parameterized constructor: The constructors that take some arguments are known as parameterized constructors.

-----------------------------------------
What is a destructor?
Contrary to constructors, which initialize objects and specify space for them, Destructors are also special methods. 
But destructors free up the resources and memory occupied by an object. Destructors are automatically called when an object is being destroyed. 

Are class and structure the same? If not, what's the difference between a class and a structure?
No, class and structure are not the same. Though they appear to be similar, they have differences that make them apart. 
For example, the structure is saved in the stack memory, whereas the class is saved in the heap memory. Also, Data Abstraction 
cannot be achieved with the help of structure, but with class, Abstraction is majorly used.

-----------------------------------------
What are virtual functions?
Virtual functions are functions that are present in the parent class and are overridden by the subclass. These functions are 
used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

-----------------------------------------
What is a final variable?
A variable whose value does not change. It always refers to the same object by the property of non-transversity.

-----------------------------------------
What is a finally block?
A finally block consists of code that is used to execute important code such as closing a connection, etc. This block executes 
when the try block exits. It also makes sure that finally block executes even in case some unexpected exception is encountered.
